## About docker networks

By default, the docker compose files in this repository are assumed that you are using `nginx-proxy-manager` to manage your network traffic. And a docker network called `npm-net` has been created before you run any docker compose files in this repo. If you do not want to use this approach, you can modify the docker compose files by yourself.
